File: self_leg/models/meter.py

Purpose:
    Meter-related domain model dataclasses for the SELF LEG settlement pipeline.
    Contains raw interval readings, 15-minute energy slot containers, and
    inbox file descriptors.

Part of:
    SELF LEG — Swiss LEG/ZEV Settlement Engine

Notes:
    Pure data containers — no business logic, no I/O.
    All datetime values are UTC internally; conversion to
    Europe/Zurich happens only at report output stage.

    Identity model:
        meter_id      — real technical meter ID from EBL/grid operator
        participant_id — business/billing identity (one per house/flat/tenant)
        label         — human-readable display name

    Energy balance invariants (hold for every slot and for the full period):
        local_shared_kwh = min(total_export_kwh, total_import_kwh)
        unmatched_export_kwh = max(0, total_export_kwh - local_shared_kwh)
        unmatched_import_kwh = max(0, total_import_kwh - local_shared_kwh)
        Σ meter_local_supplied_kwh = Σ meter_local_received_kwh = local_shared_kwh
