Purpose:
    Invoice-related domain model dataclasses for the SELF LEG settlement pipeline.
    Contains per-slot match results and per-participant billing records.

Part of:
    SELF LEG — Swiss LEG/ZEV Settlement Engine

Notes:
    Pure data containers — no business logic, no I/O.
    All datetime values are UTC internally; conversion to
    Europe/Zurich happens only at report output stage.
